## Description
Are you looking to contribute to other developers' projects, but not sure where to start? Git It Done lets you search for GitHub projects by username or topic.

Want to contribute to a known developer? Enter their username and you can see which of their projects have open issues.

Looking to make a contribution but don't have a specific user in mind? Select from a list of languages and tools to find open issues that fit your experience.

Once you find a project that intrigues you, click on it to view the list of open issues. From there, selecting an issue will take you directly to the repo that the issue belongs to.
